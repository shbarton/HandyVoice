What VoiceInk has that Handy does not
- Power Mode: per-app/URL presets applied automatically.
- Context-aware transcription: inspects screen/selection to adapt output.
- Smart Modes: quick switches for style/behavior presets (AI-powered).
- AI Assistant mode: conversational assistant separate from plain transcription.
- Personal dictionary with smart replacements/training flow (Handy only has simple custom words).

Cross-platform considerations (mac + Windows)
- Per-app presets: mac uses NSWorkspace; Windows needs foreground window/process detection (WinAPI); design a shared manager interface with platform backends and a no-op fallback on unsupported envs.
- Context awareness: mac likely uses Accessibility APIs/SelectedTextKit; Windows would need UI Automation to read selection/active window text; treat as optional capability, with graceful degradation when permissions or APIs unavailable.
- Assistant/Smart Modes: can be UI/logic only; reuse existing post-processing/LLM plumbing to avoid platform dependency.
- Dictionary/replacements: already partly covered via Handy custom words; extend to phrase-level replacements with shared Rust logic; no platform constraints.

Suggested path forward
- Start with platform-agnostic pieces: Smart Modes as named prompt/preset sets; Assistant mode that reuses LLM client; richer dictionary UI + phrase replacements.
- Add per-app presets next: build a cross-platform “active app” service (mac via NSWorkspace, Windows via WinAPI); gate feature behind capability checks.
- Investigate context-aware text: prototype mac first (accessibility), plan Windows via UIA; ensure opt-in permissions and safe fallbacks.
